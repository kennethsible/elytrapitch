If the player is flying at 40-degree angles with the elytra, they can maintain their maximum altitude and travel longer distances without expending additional rockets. Elytra Pitch adds a configurable HUD element for the player's pitch during elytra flight as well as an indicator for the optimal pitch. A custom keybinding is provided to toggle the HUD element during flight. Elytra Pitch also has [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) support as the screen position of the HUD element and the pitch range of the optimal indicator can be customized.

- ElytraPitch 1.4.1 added [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) support (_e.g._, [Elytra Slot]([https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot))) and an optional HUD delimiter.
- ElytraPitch 1.4.2 fixed crashes due to the absence of [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) and/or presence of [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins).
- ElytraPitch 1.4.3 moved the position of the optional elytra item above the HUD elements.
