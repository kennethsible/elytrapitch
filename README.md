**Elytra Pitch** is a Minecraft mod that helps players fly more efficiently with elytra. By maintaining a pitch angle of around **40 degrees**, players can glide much farther while using fewer rockets. The mod adds a customizable HUD that displays your current pitch during elytra flight, along with an indicator for the optimal angle.

Several optional features include an in-game settings menu via [Mod Menu]([https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)) for extensive customization, as well as support for accessory mods like [Elytra Slot]([https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot)) that use [Trinkets]([https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets)) or [Accessories]([https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories)). Additional HUD elements can be enabled to display **yaw**, **altitude**, **speed**, **direction**, and **elytra durability**.

Elytra Pitch also offers optional keybindings for **assisted flight**, allowing players to lock their pitch or snap to the optimal angle. This functionality revives and expands on the now-unmaintained [FlightHelper]([https://modrinth.com/mod/flighthelper](https://modrinth.com/mod/flighthelper)) mod.
