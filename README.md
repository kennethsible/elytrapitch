If a player is flying at 40-degree angles with the elytra, they can maintain their maximum altitude and travel longer distances without expending additional rockets. Elytra Pitch adds a configurable HUD element for the player's pitch during elytra flight as well as an indicator for the optimal pitch. A custom keybinding is provided to toggle the HUD element during flight. Elytra Pitch also has [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) support as the screen position of the HUD element and the pitch range of the optimal indicator can be customized.
