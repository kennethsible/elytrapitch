If a player is flying at 40-degree angles with the elytra, they can maintain their maximum altitude and travel longer distances without expending additional rockets. Elytra Pitch adds a configurable HUD element for the player's pitch during elytra flight as well as an indicator for the optimal pitch. A custom keybinding is provided to toggle the HUD element during flight. Elytra Pitch also has [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) support as the screen position of the HUD element and the pitch range of the optimal indicator can be customized.
- ElytraPitch 1.1.0 added separate settings for FP and TP, as well as text color and shadow settings.
- ElytraPitch 1.2.0 added additional, optional HUD elements for yaw, altitude, speed, and direction.
- ElytraPitch 1.3.0 added additional keybindings to lock the player's pitch and/or snap to the optimal angle.
